kiddiepool

      extremely simple memory pooling.

      leaving this code up for a reference, in case i decide to port similar
      features into future projects.

how it works

      pools are simply blocks of memory that are allocated and freed in
      sequence.

      this program will simply allow you to allocate memory on a block, once you
      allocate that memory it will save it to a list, therefore allowing you to
      only call one free function instead of having to keep track of every
      pointer that comes in and out of the object pool.
